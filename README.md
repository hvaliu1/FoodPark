# Food Park 

Project Description

The objective of this project will be to design, develop and deploy an API that is able to provide information on proper storage and handle of various food items. This API will be able to pull information from the publicly available FoodKeeper dataset found on www.data.gov, which has information on various foods but is in a format not consumable by outside applications. FoodKeeper application educates users about food and beverages storage to help them maximize the freshness and quality of these items. By helping users understand food storage, the application empowers consumers to choose storage methods that extend the shelf life of their items. By doing so users will be able to keep items fresh longer than if they were not stored properly. The API will be web based and will require API key, which will help prevent DOS/DDOS attacks, to access it. The API will follow JSON formatting.
